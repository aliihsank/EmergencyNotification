# Acil Durum Bildirim Uygulaması - Acil Durum

Project Owner : Ali İhsan KARABAL

# Vision Statement

My project is about emergency services and it is based on humanistic values.
The problem with today’s emergency services is that they are not as fast as they have to be. To access that services, you must call them and tell what you need and give information about your location.
And the problem with all these steps to access the service you need is that you lose a lot of time to explain yourself and the situation that you are in. Also there is other problems too. All staff in call center might be busy to answer your call or you may not know exactly where you are or there is a murderer in your house and you’re trying to be quite while asking for help.

So I made this app as solution to these problems. It is fast, it is quite and it knows where you are.
